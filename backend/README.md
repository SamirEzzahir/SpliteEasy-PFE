## Key Concepts

### Balance Calculation
Group balances are computed in memory from raw expense/split/settlement data:

```
net[user] = total_paid - total_owed + settlements_received - settlements_sent
```

Suggested payments use a **cash-flow minimization algorithm** (`debt.py`) — reduces the number of transactions needed to settle a group to the theoretical minimum.

### Global Settlement Modes
Each user can choose how cross-group settlements are displayed:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `separate` | Group balances are independent — global settlements not shown inside groups |
| `auto_adjust` | Global settlements automatically reduce group balances proportionally |
| `hybrid` | Shows both the original balance and the globally-adjusted balance |

### The 6-Jar System (Économé)
Income is distributed across 6 virtual jars based on a strategy (percentages must sum to 100 %):

| Jar | Code | Default % | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Necessities | `NEC` | 55 % | Rent, food, bills |
| Financial Freedom | `FFA` | 10 % | Investments |
| Education | `EDU` | 10 % | Learning |
| Long-Term Savings | `LTSS` | 10 % | Future goals |
| Play | `PLAY` | 10 % | Fun |
| Give | `GIVE` | 5 % | Charity |

### Settlement Approval Flow
```
User A records payment → status: pending
User B (recipient) reviews proof photo
    → accepts  → status: accepted
    → rejects  → status: rejected (with reason)
```
A notification is sent to the recipient on record and to the sender on accept/reject.

### RBAC
Roles store a JSON array of permission strings (e.g. `["manage_users", "view_logs"]`).
The `check_permission(permission)` dependency validates the current user's role before handler execution.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- MySQL (production) or SQLite (development — default)

### Install

```bash
# From the project root (SplitEasy/)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate     # Linux / Mac

pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create or edit `backend/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql+aiomysql://user:password@localhost:3306/spliteasy_db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

For local development with SQLite, change `DATABASE_URL` to:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./spliteasy.db
```

### Run

```bash
# From the project root (SplitEasy/)
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

API is available at `http://localhost:8000`  
Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Docker

```bash
# From inside backend/
docker build -t spliteasy-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env spliteasy-backend
```

## Notes

- All database operations are **async** — never use sync SQLAlchemy calls inside routers.
- Tables are created automatically on startup via `Base.metadata.create_all`. Custom column migrations run after that via `migrations.py`.
- `allow_origins=["*"]` is currently hardcoded in `main.py` — restrict this before deploying to production.
- The import structure requires running uvicorn from the **project root**, not from inside `backend/`, because routers use `from backend.xxx import ...`.
- MySQL-specific SQL is used in some migration helpers — SQLite may raise warnings but will not break on startup.
